import { componentsMap } from '../../components/mdx';
export const components = componentsMap;

## Why?

There's already a ton of vector libraries out there on npm. But I had trouble of finding one for my specific use-case. I needed to use it on server-side, however, most packages were built to rely on browser APIs, or, if they weren't, they hadn't good TypeScript support.
