  - **serde** - serialization and deserialization of structs
  - **reqwest** - http requests
  - **tokio** - async runtime
  - **clap** - easy cli setup
- **Docker** - dockerfile included for easy building and testing
- **AlphaVantage** - [a real-time currency exchange API](https://www.alphavantage.co/) with a free plan
