An **open-source**, **cross-platform** mod manager for [RimWorld.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/)

My biggest project so far. I decided to create it because managing huge modlists in RimWorld without an external mod manager is really painful. There are already two different solutions available: [RimPy](https://github.com/rimpy-custom/RimPy) and [RimSort](https://github.com/RimSort/RimSort) but I am not a fan of either, for various reasons.

Work on Taurim has been suspended for the time being.
