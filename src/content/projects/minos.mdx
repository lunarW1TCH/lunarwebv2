## Introduction

This is probably the project that made me grow the most as a software developer.

Minos required me to work with Arduino devices, figure out how the actual hardware works and program a bit in C++.

Arduinos were communicating through radio modules with Raspberry Pi devices which were communicating through Socket.IO with frontend app.

The whole project required me to setup two systems of communication as well as frontend and backend application to control it.
