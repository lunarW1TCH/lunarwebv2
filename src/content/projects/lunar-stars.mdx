export const components = componentsMap;

## Introduction

First website I created with a framework and TypeScript. It's main purpose was to get used to working with React and show it off as part of my portfolio.

You can visit the app however it became unfunctional just a couple of days after I finished it, because the Pixel Encounter API I used for generating images dissapeared without a trace.
