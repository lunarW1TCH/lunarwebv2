The first website I have ever built. It is actually the first project of mine that I dare say is complete and functional.

## Process of learning

Between the end of my second and beginning of the third year of university I decided to finally start learning programming for 'real'. I had some knowledge of programming before but it was never something I felt good at, so I decided to change it.

I started out with learning from a [Udemy course from Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/?couponCode=ST15MT31224). It is a huge course, over 60 hours of content but it helped me learn the ins and outs of vanilla JavaScript and gain confidence with starting to experiment on my own.

## Idea

I wanted to build an app by myself to use the knowledge I gained through the course. I knew it had to be simple in the beginning to not discourage myself by trying to tackle too big of a project for a beginner.

The website allows users to roll a set of basic [Dungeons and Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com/) dice. I am a huge dnd nerd so it seemed like a fitting first project.

Of course the website is nowhere near perfect but I am still proud of it as it reminds me how far I've come since then.
